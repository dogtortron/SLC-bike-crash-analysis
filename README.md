# Executive Summary

This project analyzes bicycle-involved crashes in Salt Lake County from 2010 to 2024. Using Python, K-means clustering, and various statistical tools, I identified high-risk locations and patterns associated with crash severity. The analysis revealed that injuries to pedalcyclists are more severe on roads with a posted speed limit of 30 mph compared to those with 25 mph or 35 mph limits. Crashes occurring on canyon roads tend to result in more severe injuries than those on non-canyon roads. Additionally, a significant number of crashes occur near intersections, indicating an elevated risk for pedalcyclists when approaching or passing through these areas.

Below is the map of severe crashes.
